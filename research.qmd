## üå± Biomass Solvolysis and Lignin Valorization

![](images/lignin-solvolysis.jpg){width=300px}

Lignin is the most abundant renewable aromatic biopolymer. However, its complex structure poses challenges for valorization.  
My research focuses on:

- **Solvent system design**: Developed mixed solvents system for room-temperature lignin dissolution, achieving up to 1 g/mL solubility.
- **Non-catalytic solvolysis mechanisms**: Investigated depolymerization pathways in various solvents using DFT and MD.
- **Monomer yield enhancement**: Elucidated the role of H-bond networks and solvent polarity in promoting guaiacol/catechol formation.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of Phenolics

![](images/hdo-catalysis.png){width=300px}

Lignin-derived phenols (e.g., guaiacol, phenol) must be deoxygenated to produce stable fuel-range molecules. I study:

- **Ni‚ÇÇP/SiO‚ÇÇ and Ni‚ÄìAl catalysts** for selective C‚ÄìO cleavage without over-hydrogenation.
- **DFT and metadynamics** to map reaction pathways and free energy surfaces.
- **Phenyl species identification** as key intermediates bridging hydrogenolysis and ring saturation routes.

Highlights:

- Proposed 4 competing HDO routes and identified energetically favored ones.
- Demonstrated solvent effects and H‚ÇÇ coverage influence on selectivity.
